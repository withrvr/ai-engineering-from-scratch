# Vendored primary sources for "Docker Sandboxes and Docker Agent 101"

Fetched on 2026-10-08 (docs pages, GitHub files, and API reads all that day; commit SHAs re-read at 11:11Z) for the manual at manuals/docker-sandboxes-101. The goal is that the audit can check every quote word for word against a local copy.

How the files are built:

- `docs-*.md` files hold the raw markdown that docs.docker.com serves at each page URL with `.md` appended. Every page starts with the line `<!-- page: <url> fetched 2026-10-08 -->`, followed by the page text as served (each page text begins with its own `# Title` heading). Page text is not edited.
- GitHub files were fetched from raw.githubusercontent.com at the pinned commit SHA named below, not from a moving branch. Single-file vendors (`agent-schema.json`, `SPEC-v3.md`, CHANGELOG, READMEs) are byte-for-byte copies of the repository file. For docker/docker-agent and docker/sandbox-kit-spec every downloaded file was checked against the byte size in the git tree listing (0 mismatches); the other READMEs were not size-checked.
- The main-branch commit SHAs of all seven repositories were re-read at the end of the run; none had moved.
- Local copies of per-page files, tree listings, and raw API responses are kept outside this directory (session scratchpad, aiefs-docker-sources-work-20261008) and are not part of the deliverable. `manifest/` keeps the URL and file lists and the per-page fetch status (252 pages: 252 OK, 0 failed, 0 HTML fallback).
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` has a checksum of every file in this directory.

## License findings (read from the repository LICENSE files, details and full texts in LICENSES.md)

- docker/docs (source of all docs-*.md): Apache-2.0. LICENSE appendix says "Copyright 2016 Docker, Inc."; README.md says "Copyright 2013-2026 Docker, Inc., released under the Apache 2.0 license".
- docker/docker-agent: Apache-2.0. The LICENSE keeps the unfilled template line "Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]". No NOTICE file.
- docker/sandbox-kit-spec: Apache-2.0. LICENSE ends with "Copyright 2026 Docker, Inc."; NOTICE says "Copyright 2026 Docker, Inc.".
- docker/model-runner: Apache-2.0, "Copyright 2025 Docker, Inc.".
- docker/compose-for-agents: dual, Apache-2.0 or MIT at the user's choice; LICENSE.MIT says "Copyright (c) 2025 Docker Inc.".
- docker/mcp-gateway: MIT, not Apache-2.0 ("Copyright (c) 2025 Docker"). This differs from the assumption in the task brief.
- docker/sbx-releases: proprietary. LICENSE reads "Copyright © 2026 Docker Inc. All rights reserved." and README.md says "Proprietary — Docker Inc.". The sbx binary and its help output follow that status. Quote the release notes and help text as short quotations only.

## Findings that matter for the audit

- The Sandbox Kit v3 specification is a pre-release (tags v3.0.0-m.1 to m.8); `SPEC-v3.md` on main differs from the m.8 tag (main names `agent-interactive-sessions@1`, the tag does not). Decide which one the manual quotes and name it.
- The legacy `docker sandbox` plugin (v0.12.0) and `docker agent` plugin (v1.32.4) are far behind the current `sbx` (v0.47.0) and `docker-agent` (v1.149.0); the help-legacy-* files are kept for comparison, not as current behavior.
- docker-agent has no v1.146.0 in the CHANGELOG or in the releases API list (v1.145.0 is followed by v1.147.0).
- sbx-releases mixes stable, rc, nightly, and dev builds; the docs release-notes page (in docs-sandboxes.md) lists only recent stable releases.

## Not fetched

Every requested item was fetched. No curl was refused by the sandbox proxy and no URL needed a retry with an added host. The following were not vendored on purpose (outside the capture list) or are absent:

- https://docs.docker.com/ai/ (the bare section URL): not requested; the research notes record it as HTTP 404.
- Other /ai/ sections: /ai/gordon (9 pages) and /ai/skills (2 pages) are not vendored. The single /ai/compose page is in docs-compose-models.md.
- Pages outside /ai/: /reference/cli/sbx (about 115 generated reference pages), /reference/cli/docker/mcp/*, /reference/cli/docker/model/*, /offload, /agentic-platform, /compose/bridge/use-model-runner/. The sbx and docker-agent help trees (help-sbx.md, help-docker-agent.md) cover the CLI surface instead.
- sandbox-kit-spec: per-capability JSON schemas (schema/capabilities/*), examples/, skills/, tck/, and Go sources.
- docker-agent repository: Go sources, and the images, gifs, mp4, svg, and site theme files under docs/. Root files AGENTS.md, SECURITY.md, golang_developer.yaml were fetched during the run but are not part of the deliverable.
- docs.docker.com page `.md` fallbacks: not needed; `docs-html/` was not created because no page needed the HTML fallback.

## Trimmed on 2026-10-08

- agent-schema.json and docker-agent-CHANGELOG.md are now the copies at tag v1.149.0 (commit bf4169cdd31229d52385410c52c3dcc59b497858), which is the pin; the main copies differed by 22 and 55 diff lines.
- sbx-releases.md keeps the stable releases only; rc, nightly, and dev builds were removed.
- docs-docker-agent-repo.md and docker-agent-releases.md were removed: the first duplicates docs-docker-agent.md, the second duplicates the CHANGELOG.
- Quotes from the Kit Spec use SPEC-v3-at-v3.0.0-m.8.md (the pinned tag); SPEC-v3.md is the main copy, cited only for unreleased changes.
- sbx help text and release notes are Docker's proprietary program output and release text. The CLI reference pages under docs.docker.com/reference/cli/sbx publish the same help text under Apache-2.0.

## Added on 2026-10-08 after the Desktop update

- help-desktop-4.94.md: the plugin list of Docker Desktop 4.94.0 on the recording host (agent v1.144.0, model v1.2.6 client with v1.2.8 server, mcp v0.44.1, sandbox v0.13.0 shim) and the removal notice that `docker sandbox` prints. Program output, captured 2026-10-08.
