# docker-agent run --sandbox, one run end to end

> One recorded `docker-agent run --sandbox` shows the kit, the sandbox, and the allowlist, and one `sbx exec` into the same VM shows the model call through the proxy.

You have an agent file with the `filesystem` and `shell` toolsets, and its model is `ai/qwen3:4b` on Docker Model Runner on your Mac. On the host, `shell` runs with your permissions. `--sandbox` moves the tools into a microVM and leaves the model on the host.

This section follows the recorded run in capture/out/27-*, step by step, and [figure](#fig-1-3) draws it. When you finish this section, you can read the launch summary of a sandboxed run and explain the two failures this run met.

```figure

title: one docker-agent run --sandbox, step by step
claim: docker-agent stages a kit, has sbx create the VM, and opens two hosts on the proxy, and the model call from inside then leaves through that proxy.
caption: Read top to bottom, one numbered row per step, and row 8 is the failure that ends the run. Rows 1 to 8 come from capture/out/27-sandbox-allow.txt, 27-sandbox-run.txt, and 27-kit-cache.txt. Rows 9 to 15 come from 27-inside-run.txt and 27-sbx-rm.txt, and the chunk name in row 12 is the stream format of the cassette 18-files.
```

## The agent file

The agent file differs from the host version only in its provider. Your host's `127.0.0.1` is "not reachable from inside the sandbox" {{docs-sbx Accessing host services from a sandbox}}, so the provider points at `host.docker.internal`:

```listing
title: the provider block of the sandboxed agent file
source: capture/fixtures/agents/files-sandbox.yaml
lang: yaml
note: Cut to the version, the provider, and the model. The agent, its instruction, and its two toolsets are cut.
---
version: "16"

providers:
  host-runner:
    provider: dmr
    base_url: http://host.docker.internal:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1

models:
  local:
    provider: host-runner
    model: ai/qwen3:4b
    temperature: 0
…
```

## Step 1: allow the model host

**Persistent allowlist:** the hosts that `docker-agent sandbox allow` stores, which "are added to the sandbox proxy's allow rules on every subsequent --sandbox run" {{help-agent docker-agent sandbox allow}}. The help names it the fix for a `Blocked by network policy` 403. The proxy translates `host.docker.internal` to `localhost`, so the capture allows `localhost:12434` before the run:

```listing
title: one host added to the persistent allowlist
source: capture/out/27-sandbox-allow.txt
lang: text
note: The welcome banner and the telemetry notice of the first run are cut, and so is the second command.
---
$ docker-agent sandbox allow localhost:12434  (--config-dir, --data-dir, --cache-dir under fixtures/repo-sandbox/.m101, inside the workspace)
…
Added 1 host(s) to the persistent sandbox allowlist:
  + localhost:12434
[exit 0]
…
```

## Step 2: keep the state directories in the workspace

The capture kit keeps docker-agent out of `~/.cagent` with `--data-dir`, `--cache-dir`, and `--config-dir`. With `--sandbox`, a data directory outside the workspace is refused, and the help gives only the default, `~/.cagent` {{help-agent docker-agent run}}. The capture kit therefore puts all three under `.m101/` in the workspace:

```listing
title: a data directory outside the workspace
source: capture/out/27-data-dir-outside.txt
lang: text
note: The command line is cut.
---
…
Error: --data-dir must be inside the sandbox's writable workspace $CAPTURE/fixtures/repo-sandbox
[exit 1]
```

## Step 3: the launch summary

```listing
title: the launch summary of docker-agent run --sandbox
source: capture/out/27-sandbox-run.txt
lang: text
note: The command line and the image pull progress are cut. The rest of the output follows in step 5.
---
…
Models gateway: none configured
Models catalog: allowlisting models.dev in the sandbox proxy
User sandbox allowlist: allowlisting 1 host(s) from `docker agent sandbox allow`:
  - localhost:12434

sandbox    docker-agent-<hash>
agent      docker-agent
workspace  $CAPTURE/fixtures/repo-sandbox (rw)
           $CAPTURE/fixtures/agents (ro)
           $CAPTURE/fixtures/repo-sandbox/.m101/cache/sandbox-kits/<hash> (ro)
           $CAPTURE/fixtures/repo-sandbox/.m101/cfg (ro)
image      docker/docker-agent-sbx-templates:latest
cpu        10
memory     32 GiB
…
✓ Created sandbox docker-agent-<hash>
```

The run set no `--models-gateway`. It allows `models.dev`, because "without it the first catalog lookup fails with a `403 Blocked by network policy` error" {{docs-agent Auto-Kit}}. The next line repeats the host from step 1.

**Auto-kit:** a directory that docker-agent stages on the host, "bind-mounted read-only into the VM at the same path" {{docs-agent Auto-Kit}}. Here it is `.m101/cache/sandbox-kits/<hash>`, and its `manifest.json` holds only `agent_ref` and `built_at` (capture/out/27-kit-cache.txt). The workspace is read-write, and the agent file's directory, the kit, and the config directory are read-only.

## Step 4: an ordinary sandbox

During the run, `sbx ls` lists `docker-agent-<hash>` with the agent `docker-agent`, the status `running`, and the same four workspaces, three of them `:ro` (capture/out/27-sbx-ls.txt). The sandbox is an ordinary one, and `sbx` lists and removes it like any other.

## Step 5: the session store fails

Inside the VM, the run stopped before any model call:

```listing
title: the end of the sandboxed run
source: capture/out/27-sandbox-run.txt
lang: text
note: The two self-update warnings before the error are cut.
---
…
Error: creating session store: migration failed even after database reset: failed to create migrations table: attempt to write a readonly database (1032)
Error: 
[exit 1]
```

The data directory sits on the `virtiofs` workspace mount, which `mount` lists as `rw`. A Python `sqlite3` write on the same mount fails the same way (capture/out/27-sqlite-probe.txt), so on this host SQLite cannot write through that mount. The run printed no safety mode, so [conflict C62](#s-ref-sources-and-the-conflicts-register) stays open. Docker Agent "exits but does not stop or remove the sandbox VM" {{docs-agent Sandbox Mode}}, and the VM stayed `running`.

## Step 6: the model call from inside

```listing
title: the agent binary and the proxy settings inside the VM
source: capture/out/27-inside.txt
lang: text
note: Cut to the version, four environment lines, and the in-VM allowlist. The other variables and the self-update warnings are cut.
---
docker-agent version main
Commit: 154b78f2d517dae1397866dfb7586c4a302a3151
…
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=proxy-managed
…
HTTP_PROXY=http://gateway.docker.internal:3128
…
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,gateway.docker.internal
OPENAI_API_KEY=proxy-managed
…
Persistent sandbox allowlist is empty.
```

The template runs `docker-agent version main`, not v1.149.0, although the docs build `:latest` from "The most recent `v*` release" {{docs-agent Sandbox Mode}}. The provider keys read `proxy-managed`. The in-VM allowlist is empty, because the allowed hosts arrive as proxy rules from the host.

The capture then starts the same agent file inside the VM by hand, with its state in `/tmp/m101`. This run shows the model path from the VM, not a working `--sandbox` launch:

```listing
title: the model call from inside the VM
source: capture/out/27-inside-run.txt
lang: text
note: The command line is cut after the state flags, and the two self-update warnings are cut.
---
$ sbx exec docker-agent-<hash> sh -c 'docker-agent --config-dir /tmp/m101 --data-dir /tmp/m101 --cache-dir /tmp/m101 run --exec --last …
…
The working directory contains README.md with 1 line.
[exit 0]
```

The request to `host.docker.internal:12434` leaves through `HTTP_PROXY`, because that host is not in `NO_PROXY`. "The sandbox proxy translates `host.docker.internal` to `localhost` before forwarding the request" {{docs-sbx Accessing host services from a sandbox}}, and the rule from step 1 admits it. The answer is correct: the capture kit copies the same README into every workspace, and it holds the one line `hello` (capture/out/04-workspace.txt).

## Step 7: remove the sandbox

```listing
title: the removal
source: capture/out/27-sbx-rm.txt
lang: text
note: Nothing is cut.
---
$ sbx rm --force docker-agent-<hash>
Deleting sandbox docker-agent-<hash>...
Sandbox 'docker-agent-<hash>' removed
[exit 0]
```

A later run from the same workspace reuses the VM, and creates a new one "only when the mount set has changed" {{docs-agent Sandbox Mode}}.

```takeaways
- Allow each host service with `docker-agent sandbox allow localhost:PORT` before the first sandboxed run.
- Expect `--sandbox` to refuse a `--data-dir` outside the workspace, and test that SQLite can write inside it first.
- Read the launch summary for each mount mode, the image, and every allowed host.
- Remove the sandbox with `sbx rm` when you no longer need it, because docker-agent leaves it running.
