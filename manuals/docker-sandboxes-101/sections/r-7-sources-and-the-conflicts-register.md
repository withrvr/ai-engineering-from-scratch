# Sources and the conflicts register

> Two help trees, one schema, one kit specification, the vendored docs, the release notes, and one capture kit, with a ruling for every conflict a section touches.

The pin is sbx 0.47.0 and docker-agent 1.149.0 (manual.json). The agent file schema is at version 16, and the Sandbox Kit Spec at milestone v3.0.0-m.8. The pin date is 2026-10-07, and the facts were verified on 2026-10-08. Every file named below lives under `research/sources/`, and `research/sources/README.md` records its origin, commit, line count, and license.

## The ranked sources

When two sources disagree, the higher one wins and the section says so. The table repeats the ranking of manual.json with the citation keys of `quoteSources`.

| Rank | Source | Cited as | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | the help text that sbx 0.47.0 and docker-agent 1.149.0 print | `help-sbx`, `help-agent` with the command | every command, flag, default, and path |
| 2 | the agent file schema at v1.149.0 | `schema` with the definition | every key, type, and default of the agent file |
| 3 | Sandbox Kit Spec v3 at tag v3.0.0-m.8 | `kitspec` with the section, `kitspec-main` for unreleased changes, `kitcap` for a capability page | the kit descriptor and each capability |
| 4 | the Docker documentation, fetched 2026-10-08 | `docs-sbx`, `docs-agent`, `docs-dmr`, `docs-mcp`, `docs-sbx-api`, `docs-desktop` with the page | rules and limits the help text does not state |
| 5 | the release notes | `rel-sbx`, `rel-agent` with the version | when a behaviour appeared, changed, or was removed |
| 6 | Docker blog posts and talks, through the research files | `blog`, `talk` with a date, declared `null` | history and positioning only, never a rule |
| 7 | the capture kit | the file under `capture/out/` | every command output, file, and record shown |

## The conflicts register

`research/conflicts-register.md` holds 122 conflicts, C1 to C122, in nine groups, and 30 pieces of stale advice, S1 to S30. The table below keeps every C row that a section entry of the plan cites or whose ruling names a section. That is 94 rows, each with the ruling the manual follows. The 28 rows that no section uses are cut to keep the table short, and the next table names them by group. Their substance appears in the S rows below or in the register itself. Kind is the register's own label.

| Group | Rows cut |
|---|---|
| A, sbx | C1, C2, C3, C5, C6, C8, C10, C11, C14, C22, C23, C24, C30 |
| B, docker-agent | C55, C57, C74 |
| C, Docker Model Runner | C78, C80, C81, C82, C85 |
| D, MCP gateway and Toolkit | C86, C87 |
| E, Compose | C94, C95, C97 |
| F, Offload | C100 |
| G, Cloud Sandboxes | C102 |

| Id | Kind | What disagrees | Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|
| C4 | talk vs docs | libkrun or Firecracker as the VMM, against a VMM Docker wrote | A VMM Docker wrote, on Hypervisor.framework, WHP, and KVM. libkrun stays unverified |
| C7 | removed | API keys exported in the shell, against the secret store since v0.35.0 | Secrets come from the secret store. `-e KEY` is a plain variable, not a secret |
| C9 | docs vs CLI | five to nine agent names in blogs, against 11 in `sbx run --help` | The 11 names of the help, the 8 `create` subcommands, and `cagent` as an alias |
| C12 | docs vs repo | a 512 MB default kit volume, against 20 GiB in the spec docs | Both numbers with their sources, no single default |
| C13 | docs vs CLI | v1, v2, and v3 kits, against `sbx kit` commands that name only v1 and v2 | The `sbx kit` artifact commands are v1 and v2 tooling. A v3 kit is an OCI image built with Docker tooling |
| C15 | community vs docs | no Docker Desktop needed, against a required sign-in | Both true. No Desktop, but a Docker account sign-in |
| C16 | undocumented | `sbx mount`, `sbx ssh proxy`, `sbx policy approval`, `--model`, `--provider`, `--usb` in text, absent from the tree | Only what `--help` prints, and one note on the hidden names |
| C17 | undocumented | plugin-era state directories, against the sbx state directory | No state migration exists |
| C18 | docs vs CLI | `platform.allowExperimentalFeatures` default `false` in the docs, `true` in the CLI | The value and SOURCE column from the capture |
| C19 | docs vs CLI | `feature.*` keys in the docs, absent from `sbx settings list` | Only keys the CLI returns, plus a note on the documented ones |
| C20 | undocumented | four `ssh.*` keys in the CLI, absent from the docs: `ssh.autoCreate`, `ssh.defaultAgent`, `ssh.defaultTemplate`, and `ssh.workspaceRoot` | Included, with the full descriptions of `sbx settings list --json` |
| C21 | docs vs CLI | 11 built-in secret services in the docs, 13 in the CLI | 13 services |
| C25 | renamed | the plugin name rule, against the sbx rule | The sbx rule: 2 to 63 characters, letters, digits, hyphens, periods, `default` reserved |
| C26 | undocumented | `host.docker.internal:3128` or `gateway.docker.internal:3128`, against docs with no address | The address and variables the capture shows |
| C27 | blog stale | UDP and ICMP blocked for good, against UDP behind `feature.udp-egress` | UDP rules exist behind the experimental flag. ICMP is blocked. DNS is policy-controlled |
| C28 | experimental | filesystem policies in `ls` and audit, against `policy log` that does not support them | Filesystem rules list but do not log in v0.47.0 |
| C29 | talk vs docs | near-instant start, against seconds | The manual's own timing on one machine, no vendor number |
| C31 | removed | `docker sandbox exec -d`, against `sbx exec -d` not supported | Said so in 2.2 |
| C32 | renamed | `docker sandbox save` into the host daemon, against the runtime image store | Said so in 2.3 and the migration table |

| C35 | docs vs CLI | `proxy-managed` sentinels, against `GHO_SBX_PROXY_MANAGED` and `docker-placeholder-value` | The captured values |
| C36 | docs vs docs | cloud needs 0.45.0, against 0.45.1 | 0.45.1 |

| C39 | removed | `-p` binds both loopbacks, against `tcp4` since v0.42.0 | The `tcp4` rule |
| C40 | removed | kits from any registry, against `kit.allowedSources` since v0.34.0 | The setting is changed for a local registry and the error without it is shown |
| C41 | removed | global rules only, against per-sandbox policies since v0.29.0 | The two scopes `global` and `local` |
| C42 | docs vs CLI | `ssh <name>.sbx` through a managed block, against `sbx setup ssh` details | The help text facts |

| C52 | removed | `cagent config`, `feedback`, `build`, `catalog`, `exec`, against the v1.23.4 restructure | Migration rows S6 and S7 |

| C54 | renamed | a complete rename, against directories still named `cagent` | The paths as they are |
| C56 | docs vs repo | `handoff` and `transfer_task` as types, against 27 types without them | Not a type. Separate rows marked implicit |

| C63 | docs vs CLI | `<data-dir>/session.db`, against `session.db` in the current directory for `serve api` | Both defaults |

| C98 | blog stale | 300 free GPU minutes, against no public price | Offload is out of scope |
| C99 | docs vs docs | Offload as the cloud path, against `sbx --cloud` | Said so in 7.1 |
| C101 | docs vs docs | prices documented, against prices in a blog and `template load --help` | Shapes from the help, prices from the blog with its date |
| C103 | docs vs docs | pay-as-you-go on a Personal account, against Personal and Pro | Personal or Pro, the rest unverified |
| C104 | docs vs docs | `docker exec` and healthchecks work in the cloud, against the VM filesystem being reached instead | A documented limitation |
| C105 | talk vs docs | Warp Oz on Docker cloud sandboxes, against no confirmation | Omitted |
| C106 | blog stale | the sandbox primitive inside Kubernetes, against no other mention | Omitted |
| C107 | removed | the plugin still in Desktop, against removal in 4.80.0 | The error text the capture shows |
| C108 | removed | `--mount-docker-socket`, `--load-local-template`, `--pull-template`, against none in sbx | Migration rows S1 to S4 |
| C109 | renamed | `network proxy` flags, against `policy` subcommands with no bypass | Migration rows S10 and S11, bypass with no replacement found |
| C110 | removed | the legacy default allowed hosts, against three presets | The legacy list only in 7.3 |
| C111 | removed | `cagent` in Desktop, against removal in 4.81.0 | Migration row S8 |
| C112 | removed | keys from the daemon environment and state under `~/.docker/sandboxes/`, against the sbx store | One table in 7.3 |
| C113 | docs vs CLI | index annotations that the frontend promotes (kitspec §9.3), against an index with an attestation manifest and no annotations | 4.1 prints both. The annotations sit on the platform manifest (`28-index.json`, `28-manifest.json`), which a consumer reads when the index has none |
| C114 | docs vs CLI | a floating `docker/sandbox-kit:3` that never moves for a milestone, against a resolve to 3.0.0-m.8 | 4.1 prints both (`28-buildx.txt`). A build that needs the same frontend every time names the exact version tag |
| C115 | docs vs CLI | `docker buildx build -f kit.yaml --push` as the publish command, against a schema 2 manifest with no annotations from the default `docker` driver | 4.1 says to build with a `docker-container` builder (`28-manifest-docker-driver.json`, `28-manifest.json`). An image without the annotation is not a kit |
| C116 | docs vs CLI | a local source directory passed to `sbx` during development, against `sbx kit inspect` failing on Desktop 4.94.0 | 4.1 prints both (`13-kit-v3-inspect.txt`, `28-kit-inspect-source.txt`). No capture ran `sbx run` on a directory |
| C117 | docs vs CLI | source builds in the `sbx-kit-builder` sandbox, against a build through the host Docker daemon and a builder "not created" | 4.1 and 4.3 print the help line and the status (`13-kit-builder-status.txt`). Where a successful source build runs stays unstated |
| C118 | docs vs repo | agent file config version `15` as current, against a schema enum to `"16"` and captured files that load | `"16"` from the schema (5.2, R.4). The docs page still names `15` |
| C119 | docs vs CLI | session titles made from the first message, against five sessions titled `Running agent` | 5.6 prints the five rows (`21-session-db.txt`) |
| C120 | docs vs CLI | a skill name and mode lists that A2A 1.0.1 requires, against a card with an empty skill name and two empty mode lists | 6.3 prints the card against the rules (`23-agent-card.json`). A client accepts the empty values |
| C121 | docs vs CLI | "A2A artifact support not yet integrated", against a task whose artifacts hold the answer | 6.3 says the capture contradicts the limitation (`23-a2a.http`) |
| C122 | docs vs CLI | a release note that points to `docker sbx`, against a notice that points to the product page and a plugin list that still shows `sandbox v0.13.0` | 7.3 prints the notice (`29-docker-sandbox.txt`, `29-docker-plugins.txt`). The plugin entry stays, and the command only prints the notice |
